- test teams
- input team names
- SHOWSTOPPER: handle synchronization of /history.txt
- use frequency of occurrence in generating new block list after victory
- verify setuid and setgid (vs setresuid) in shuffl
- consider malicious padding of shellcode with non-used bytes to disable them

# Probably WONTFIX
- increase the initial set of blocked bytes from 1 to whatever fairly reliably breaks pwntools
- consider fluffing of final shellcode with bytes to evade the random.choice

# WONTFIX
- secure /tmp and /var/tmp (chroot instead)
- consider cross-talk between shellcodes
- super reduce runner (maybe turn it into a tinyelf)
